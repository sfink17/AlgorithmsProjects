# KDTree
This is an implementation of a KDTree with balancing. The "boid" related files were provided by
Princeton, and act as a vizualization client for the API.

This project was completed in three days as part of the Princeton Algorithms project assignment series.
All clients within this package were provided by Princeton under the GNU GPLv3 public licence. 
Implementation of KDTree API is entirely original.
