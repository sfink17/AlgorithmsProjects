# AutoComplete
Autocomplete client with included GUI. This autocomplete utilizes several sorting methods to display matches rapidly, alongside
a smallest/largest binary search implementation to get quick range checks. Support for an original RadixSort implementation
is included, alongside provided quicksort and mergesort implementations.

This project was completed in four days as part of the Princeton Algorithms project assignment series. All clients within this package were provided by Princeton under the GNU GPLv3 public licence. Implementation of the API is entirely original.
