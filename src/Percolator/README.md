# Percolator

This is an implementation of a percolation vizualizer, utilizing a union find algorithm for percolate checks. To display proper percolation without a "backwash" effect, each visited square is given a binary status code, updated upon merging with other components.

This project was completed in three days as part of the Princeton Algorithms project assignment series. All clients within this package were provided by Princeton under the GNU GPLv3 public licence. Implementation of SeamCarver API is entirely original.
